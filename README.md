This project took about 8-10 hours this week. I followed the steps under implementing your router on the HW page and found it very helpful. The tests were also a good way of making sure we implemented each part correctly. Overall I liked this project. I also found it very helpful how we were given a starter code because it kept us very organized throughout the project.
